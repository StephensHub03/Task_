🚗💻 New Project Showcase: Car Collection Website 🔧🚙

Excited to share my latest web design project — a Car Collection Website built entirely using HTML & CSS. This website is a sleek and minimal front-end layout designed to display luxury, classic, and modern car models in an organized and attractive format.

🔹 Project Highlights:
✅ Visually appealing layout for different car models
✅ Clean card-based design with car name, details & pricing
✅ Category filtering or brand-based sections (optional)
✅ Fully responsive using custom CSS
✅ Optimized for user-friendly browsing experience

🛠️ Tools Used:
✔ HTML
✔ CSS
✔ Font Awesome for icons
✔ Google Fonts for styling

This project helped me improve my layout structuring, spacing, and visual hierarchy using just pure HTML & CSS.

Feel free to check it out and share your feedback! I'm always looking to grow and connect with fellow devs and designers. 🚀
